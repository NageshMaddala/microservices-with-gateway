Communication (sync/async)

Synchronous Communication -
- Sync communication was never a problem in relatively small monolithic applications because
  it is a very simple concept to reason about
- The client sends a request to the server, and the server responds to the client.
- An advantage of sync communication is that the service receives an ack that the request was received
  and the corresponding action was exectuted

Async Commnication -
- When using async communication, the calling service does not wait for a response from the called service
- Async communication also allows the possibility of One to Many communication, where a client can send a 
  message to multiple services at once

In the arch diagram, solid lines are sync commnication
and dotted line are async communication
